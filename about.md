I grew up in a place where it was perfectly normal for an agent to declare ownership of something you had been owning until that moment. That agent had nothing to do with law enforcement, but exclusively with the economic term of a decision maker whose actions are made by solving a well-defined optimization problem. Far be it from me to make a normative statement: I just got the opportunity to quickly grasp an intuition about games, especially non-cooperative ones. The moment I started to think about things, I could not refrain myself anymore of not thinking in terms of games.

I spent most of my life playing games.[[While in the first draft of this page I loudly expressed how I was not referring to videogames but any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision makers, I am not doing it anymore because they are actually the same thing. However, I am now constrained to use a more complex vocabulary to convince people this is a blog about more serious stuff. Kind of.::lsn]] First competitive Call of Duty 2, then professional poker. When I turned 18, I was tired of such complex games, so I tried to do something easier: I dropped out of college and moved to Thailand to open my own restaurant.
After not even one year since the opening of the first one, we were launching a third restaurant. Right at that moment, I decided to sell my shares and move to the US. I thought food was my passion, but I realized I was wrong: it was creating what people need that would improve their life.[[However, it has to be said that the Neapolitan pizza I was making definitely had the attributes to improve people's lives.::rsn]]

While studying business[[Until this day, I do not absolutely understand what the sentence 'studying business' means.::rsn]] in a community college, I worked as Growth Manager[[In the first draft, Growth Manager did not have capitalized initials. Nevertheless, I had to quickly change it after realizing that Call of Duty had.::rsn]] for two consumer software startups. Creating products is a job that is constantly strangled by bitter time constraints, yet it made me constantly lose track of the time. I know I was into something. One day, a few people from Columbia University's admission office thought it was a good idea to send an acceptance letter to a guy with a heavy thick Italian accent, who went from kneading dough in Thailand to creating software apps in California.[[I listed the activities in decreasing order. I'm not going to say by which parameter though.::rsn]] From my point of view, I was just an agent solving optimization problems and now I had to solve a difficult one: getting an ivy league education or building my own startup. Lacking a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, I had to play matching pennies: while studying Economics and Statistics[[I, therefore, give fault to the institution of Columbia University in the City of New York for sealing on me the stamp of not being able to write normally without the necessity to showcase some sort of intellectuality. I promise I was not like this before.::rsn]], I founded Geodome, a virtual reality startup that allowed people to see how clothes would fit on their body before buying them.

I admit to having searched on Quora more than once "Are game theorists good at games?". The answer by Skrzypacz, Stanford's Economics Professor, made me feel good: "No". That is because I had recently discovered I was pretty bad at optimization problems when during my time at Columbia I also became an executive board member for the Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs. Of the thousands of lessons I had the opportunity to receive during my experience here, the most valuable was when I directed Founderschool. It was a peer-led class at Columbia University that taught students how to build their first startup. While I was teaching them, they were also teaching me: creating new products was what I wanted to be doing for all my life, whatever this means executive in a startup, product manager in a corporation or investor in venture capital.

In the Non-Cooperative Infinitely Repeated Games of life [[I had to capitalize it: it is the title of the blog.::lsn]], my strictly dominant strategy will always be of creating or helping create what people need which would improve their lives.

[[Twitter::https://twitter.com/dariogentiletti]] – Shoot me a dm or just tweet ***@dariogentiletti***. I can guarantee[[I cannot.::lsn]] I will reply within the same day. That is more the place for casual conversations, so do not care about typos or format.

[[LinkedIn::https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgentiletti/]] – Feel free to connect with me. Except if you are trying to sell me a B2B marketing web app subscription, I will be happy to accept any connection that is work related. Just add "*dariogentiletti.com*" in the request's note so I can track how many people come from this blog.

[[Email (public@dariogentiletti.com)::mailto:public@dariogentiletti.com]][[If you ever go to *Napoli (Italy)*, drop an email and include [Napoli] in the subject line: I will personally write to you a guide on how to visit Napoli as a local and enjoy the best food of the country.::rsn]] [[ If you walk by *Brooklyn* and want to grab a coffee without dressing too formal, just include [Coffee]: I will be happy to know you.::rsn]] – Send me an email for anything that requires a bit more of my computing power: startup ideas, philosophy, and anything else that pretty much falls in the category of personal opinions that can be used against me one day. I set up specific time windows during the day to answer emails, and I snooze them if they require more time than I have at that moment. It is not the best way if you need a quick response, but I can guarantee[[I cannot.::lsn]] an answer as thoughtful as I can.
