When I finally graduated in April 2020, as every other student I had to take the graduation pictures. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic was rising in New York and it was definitely not easy to find a photographer during such times. However, something even more difficult was to look at those pictures the day after. Transferring from a community college to an Ivy League and wanting to graduate just in 2 years while being a startup founder, I spent most of my time sitting in a library, without any physical exercise and with unhealthy food habits. When I looked at those pictures, I finally became aware of the 23 pounds that I gained over the last two years. Before trasferring to Columbia, I was playing college football and probably I was in the peak of my shape. Now, it was the opposite and I had to take my body back.

Having been an athlete most of my life, I had a lot of knowledge about nutrition. I was not going to follow any specific diet, but just eating less calories than the ones I burned. After I calculated my TDEE [[Total Daily Energy Expenditures — a measure of how many calories you burn per day::rsn]], I know I just had to eat less than 1300 calories to lose weight. You do not need any other special or trendy technique. [It is so simple, but where many people fail is to accurately track calories.](https://physiqonomics.com/eating-too-much/ "Physiqonomics' Article of Tracking Calories").

For the first month of my diet, I was using the traditional fitness apps: MyFitnessPal and LoseIt. However, I quickly noticed that there were many unreliable information about the calories of the food I was eating. Without an accurate tracking, my plan was going to fail: I needed to find a more reliable tool.
I started to try every possible fitness and calories tracking app. One day, while reading Hacker News, I found an article about "Deep Learning Meets Food Logging".  In that moment I discovered Bitesnap, but I never imagined that would be most useful app that will lead me to lose 25 pounds in 2 months.

### What is Bitesnap?

![Logo](/assets/img/kp-challenge/logo-with-text.png)

Bitesnap is a mobile app that uses deep learning to recognize food in your pictures and automatically calculate calories and nutrients. 

There are three main features that Bitesnap offers to its users:
1. **Logging a meal by just taking a picture** — When taking a picture of the food through the app, it suggests you on what you are eating and automatically find all the calories and nutrients of that food — the process does not take more than 10 seconds.
2. **Explore eating patterns visually** — There are two visual ways that Bitesnap shows eating patterns to the users. The first is through the photo journal, which an user can visualize by scrolling the homepage and seeing all the meals they had in the past days. The second is through the data charts available in the menu, where an user can look not only at the calories they had in the past days, but also on the amount of protein, fiber, vitamin D, and every other possible nutrient.
3. **Personalized Predictions** — Bitesnap uses machine learning to customize itself for each user. This means that the app visually learns the user's habits over time, and it is able to provide predictions on what the user is eating. In fact, more the user use the app, better the algorithms becomes at identifying the food in the pictures.


## Why am I obsessed with Bitesnap?

I have been using MyFitnessPal for over 3 years. After, I switched to LoseIt for 2 years. However, it took me one day of using Bitesnap to make me switch to this app without absolutely any single doubt. At the time I'm writing this article, I have lost 25 pounds in two months. While my motivation and discipline played an important role, I would have not been successful with my strategy if it was not for Bitesnap. I identified two main reasons on why, out of thousands of calories tracking app that have hundreds of employees and years of development, I stuck with Bitesnap, built by just two people a few years ago.

### It does the most important thing, and it does it seamlessly.

When I found MyFitnessPal, I just wanted to track my calories. I downloaded it because it was the most popular. However, everytime I was opening the app I had to go through the "Blog", the "Water Log", the "Exercises" and much more. I had to click a few buttons and spend more time than I wanted just to add what I ate that day and how many calories I still have left. The second most important thing for me was to track the amount of carbs, because I did not want to eat more than 35% of carbs during a day. It was so hard to find how to visualize my macro, that for the first months I believed MyFitnessPal did not have such feature.

After a long pause, I started a ketogenic diet and I needed to track my food again. This time, I was done with MyFitnessPal's User Experience, and I wanted something simpler, that would not steal more than five minutes of my day. I found LoseIt, which had a much quicker experience to add new food. With just two clicks, I was able to add what I ate directly from the homepage. There were other features such as exercise and water log, but they were hidden or not in the homepage. However, the business model of LoseIt was terrible for me: to look at some data, you needed to buy the subscription. The worst thing is that one of the data restricted for the premium users was the macronutrients! I was unable to see how many carbs, proteins and fat I was eating each day, and that was an huge limit, especially when doing a ketogenic diet [[A ketogenic diet consists of reducing the amount of carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day.]]. As with MyFitnessPal, I struggled to be consistent and I found myself forgetting to use the app over and over again.

When I downloaded Bitesnap, I was amazed by how everything I needed was right there where I wanted it: the first two things that appear in the main screen are calories and macronutrients. It is a simple and intuitive UI that gives me all the information I want in the quickest way possible. An important thing to consider for calories tracking app is that users want to use them as less as possible: tracking calories can already be a time-consuming activity, and users need a quick and seamless experience just to find out how much left they have to eat; they do not want to spend even more time just add a food item on an app, or go through dozens of features they are never going to use it.

With Bitensap, I open the app, click on the camera, take a picture of the food and confirm. I was skeptic on the deep learning, but in two months I only had one or two meals not recognized. Surprisingly, it was able to recognize the meals even under poor light conditions or sligthly blurry pictures. I was looking for a tool to track calories, and Bitesnap does it, in the quickest and most seamless way.

### I can trust its accuracy.

Back when I was tracking my calories with MyFitnessPal or LoseIt, I was always double checking the calories that the app was telling me with some reliable source online. This is because both apps use a crowdsource database, where everyone can create a meal with its information and add it to the database. Therefore, when I am adding a food item, it is possible that I'm using one added by another person, and that's not always reliable. For this reason, I had to doublecheck online (and therefore wasting more time), and I was always adding ~100 calories to my total at the end of the day, to capture any miscalculation and underestimation. 

Bitesnap does not use crowdsourcing: instead, it only retrieves food nutritional facts from official databases, such as the governmental USDA FoodData Central. When I take a picture of the food and the app understand which one is it, I just need to confirm its quantity. I do not need to double check or adjust the nutritional facts. At the end of the day, I'm completely confident of how many calories I ate [[And, as we seen in the article linked in the introduction, this is one of the most common mistakes people do when tracking calories.]], and what are my macronutrients percentages. 

While the lack of crowdsourcing can be perceived as a limiting factor, I would say that it has been the main motivator for me to stick with Bitesnap: crowdsourcing is helpful to have every single possible item registered; while official databases have information about the most common items, they do not have the nutritional facts about some south asian traditional dish or northern Italian home-made recipe. If you use crowdsource, someone will be adding them, but that was not what I needed — I needed a reliable source of information. When Bitesnap does not have a certain food item (it did not happen more than eight item in the last two months), I can easily create a new one, adding manually the nutritional facts. That item is not shared with other people, so when you search you can only find food information from the official databases or the ones you created. Most importantly, official databases provide additional facts such as vitamins, minerals, caffeine etc. This is a gamechanger because until now I was able only to track calories, and sometimes macronutrients; however, I had no idea about the vitamins that I was lacking or the amount of caffeine drunk each day. This is because when you use crowdsourcing, people do not insert those information when adding a new item. With Bitesnap, I have easily look at the amount of vitamins I'm eating each day, I can instantly see any lack through data charts and I can set daily targets for those more specific nutritional facts. Being all retrieved from official governmental database, I feel confident about its accuracy.

### What can be improved?



#### Crowdsourced Barcode

![The user journey, from a picture to the food journal](/assets/img/kp-challenge/screenshots.jpg)

While it has been inserted in the most recent update, the feature of scanning barcode does not work consistently with many items. One should not use deep learning for packaged food: it is not only stupid, but it can also return wrong predictions. While it is important to not have a crowdsourced databases for general food items, it is different for the items that have been scanned through barcodes. In fact, it can be useful to have a shared database with such items, where the nutritional facts are not manually inserted by the user but retrieved by official sources. Instead of adding all the products manually, users will add them when scanning through with the barcode: in this way, if now I'm eating a Snickers, I can just search it and find it if someone else already scanned its barcode. Scanning barcode is not a funny experience after the first times, so it is important that Bitesnap does not stress the user requiring him to scan every time an item that has already been previously scanned by other users.

#### Additional Serving Sizes
One of the only thing that deep learning cannot accurately predict [[For now.::rsn]]], it is the quantity of the food. There are way too difficulties to understand how much of an item is present on a picture, so you often have to set it yourself. Bitesnap does a good job with predictions, so that most of the time it already suggests you the right size. However, the serving size are often limited to a metric that users cannot be familiar with. In my example, as an European I have no idea how much one ounce is. While I understand that this measurements are probably obtained directly from the official databases, they can be easily converted in other measurements. This is critical if the app want to expand to other states or nations, where people are used to measure food with different scales or countries use a completely different metric system.
